# Calculator

A simple yet profound implementation of a calculator.
Learnt the amazing implementability (is that a word?) of classes. Having first hand experience with java, this seemed so much easier and similar.
Although my first few attempts failed for which I've kept the script.js file as it is, it shall be updated as I get upskilled.
For now I love my work.
Thank you Odin Project and all the tutors.
